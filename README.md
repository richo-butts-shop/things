Some things I made. I'm trying to mirror them on thingiverse but this is the
canonical location. As much as possiblee I'm including thee source (STEP and
whatever package I designed it in) but feel free to ping me.

At a high level the structure looks like;

* [airplane](airplane): Stuff I printed for my Super Decathlon. Mostly mounts for various things in the cockpit.
* [bike-stuff](bike-stuff): Stuff I printed for my bike. Much of it is bike specific (08 cbr 1000 rr), but with the .steps included it should be easy to adapt.
* [hat-adaptor](hat-adaptor): My noggin is too big for a hat I was sent so I made an adaptor for it.
* [umarells](umarells): If you know, you know.
